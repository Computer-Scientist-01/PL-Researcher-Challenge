## 6.042J: Mathematics for Computer Science (Fall 2010)

### Course Overview
This course covers elementary discrete mathematics for computer science and engineering. It emphasizes mathematical definitions and proofs as well as applicable methods.

### Description
Topics include formal logic notation, proof methods; induction, well-ordering; sets, relations; elementary graph theory; integer congruences; asymptotic notation and growth of functions; permutations and combinations, counting principles; discrete probability. Further selected topics may also be covered, such as recursive definition and structural induction; state machines and invariants; recurrences; generating functions.

### Instructors
Prof. Tom Leighton, Dr. Marten van Dijk.

### Prerequisites
No explicit prerequisites are mentioned.

### Why This Course Fits the PL Researcher Challenge
This course provides foundational discrete mathematics and proof techniques essential for programming language research, including logic, induction, graphs, and probability, which are crucial for analyzing language semantics, formal verification, and computational models.

### Details on Mathematics for Computer Science for This Challenge
Mathematics for Computer Science is fundamental for PL research, offering tools for rigorous reasoning about algorithms, data structures, and theoretical aspects of languages. It focuses on discrete structures like graphs and relations, which model program behaviors, and proof methods for verifying language properties. For the PL Researcher Challenge, this course builds analytical precision for advanced topics like theory of computation (18.404) and algorithms (6.1210), preparing you for work on type systems or verified compilers with experts like Stephanie Weirich or Zhong Shao. Self-studying here cultivates the mathematical maturity needed for independent research without formal enrollment.
