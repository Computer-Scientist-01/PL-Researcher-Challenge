## 6.001: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Spring 2005)

### Course Overview
This MIT course introduces the principles of computation, enabling students to explain and apply basic methods from programming languages to analyze computational systems and generate solutions to abstract problems. It features substantial weekly programming assignments as an integral part. The course is undergraduate level, offered in Spring 2005 by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and is worth 4 Engineering Design Points.

Key topics include engineering, computer science, theory of computation, mathematics, and computation. No prerequisites are required.

Instructors: Prof. Eric Grimson, Prof. Peter Szolovits, Prof. Trevor Darrell.

### Why This Course Fits the PL Researcher Challenge
This course provides a foundational understanding of computational thinking and programming paradigms, which is essential for aspiring PL researchers. It emphasizes abstraction, recursion, data structures, and interpreters—core concepts that underpin programming language design, semantics, and implementation. By mastering these, you build the intuition needed for advanced topics like compilers and type systems in later electives.

### Details on SICP for This Challenge
The course is based on the textbook *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP, 2nd edition, by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman). SICP is a classic in computer science education, using Scheme (a Lisp dialect) to teach timeless principles rather than specific languages. For the PL Researcher Challenge, SICP is particularly valuable because it treats programs as mathematical objects, exploring evaluation models, higher-order procedures, and meta-circular evaluators. This aligns with PL research goals, such as understanding language interpreters and lazy evaluation, which are crucial for theoretical work at places like Microsoft Research or with professors like Stephanie Weirich. Self-studying SICP here strengthens discipline and conceptual depth, serving as a bridge to more advanced PL theory without relying on formal enrollment.
